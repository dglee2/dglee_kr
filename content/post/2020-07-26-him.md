되는일이 없을때,</br>

>“I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.” – Michael Jordan

실패가 두려울때나... 용기가 필요할 때에는,</br>

>“Courage doesn't mean you don't get afraid. Courage means you don't let fear stop you.” -  Bethany Hamilton

힘내시오...
